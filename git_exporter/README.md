# Home Assistant Git Exporter


This is a small fork based on the awesome addon from [Poeschl](https://github.com/Poeschl/Hassio-Addons)
There are no changes worth mentioning, it's just that my setup is a bit weird and as such I required some other file permissions.

Export all of your Home Assistant configuration to a git repository of your choice.
Can be used to show your Home Assistant setup in public repositories.

# Functionality

* Export Home Assistant configuration
* Export Supervisor Addon configuration
* Export Lovelace configuration
* Export ESPHome configurations
* Check for plaintext secrets based on your `secrets.yaml` file and common patterns.
* Check for plaintext ip and addresses in your config.
