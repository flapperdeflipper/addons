/**
 * Generate the context files the add-on injects into OpenCode's prompt.
 *
 *   /data/context/home-briefing.md   what this Home Assistant installation is
 *
 * Run detached from `init-opencode` so add-on start-up never waits on Home
 * Assistant, and again on demand from `ha-context refresh`.
 *
 * The briefing is written in two passes. The filesystem scan works whether or
 * not Core is up, so it is written immediately; the parts that need a running
 * Home Assistant are retried in the background and the file is rewritten once
 * they arrive. Core is frequently still starting when the add-on does, and a
 * partial briefing beats no briefing.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   SUPERVISOR_TOKEN               required for anything live
 *   OPENCODE_HOME_BRIEFING         "true" to generate the briefing
 *   OPENCODE_ADDON_ACCESS_ENABLED, SCREENSHOT_ENABLED, OPENCODE_MCP_ENABLED,
 *   OPENCODE_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE,
 *   OPENCODE_LSP_ENABLED, OPENCODE_RESTRICT_SENSITIVE_FILES, Z2M_URL
 *                                  reported under "Add-on capabilities"
 *   HOME_CONTEXT_SINGLE_PASS       "true" to try Home Assistant once instead of
 *                                  retrying (used by `ha-context refresh`)
 *   HOME_CONTEXT_CONFIG_DIR        override the configuration directory to scan
 *   HOME_CONTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR        override where the context files are written
